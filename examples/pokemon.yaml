  Python program that incorporates the open source PokeAPI. The steps for this task are as follows:
  • Utilize the open source PokeAPI to retrieve information on various Pokemon.
  • The program should display the Pokemon’s abilities once the user enters the name.

- then add also section that lists game locations where given pokemon can appear specificaly in version Blue, for that you need a key given by encounters table where you can check id of pokemon, id of location area and then connect a name of area using location areas and location names tables
